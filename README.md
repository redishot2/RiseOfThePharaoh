Rise of the Pharaoh

Rise of the Pharaoh was a game designed and brought to completion in one semester (ten week time frame)
I worked in a team of four with Amanda Rivet, Kevin Murnan and Ben Sherman. I was the level designer. 
I created an outside program that would create levels in a visual way. 
The level editor saved the levels in a file format that easily transfered into XNA. 
The game is simple in both it's mechanics and gameplay. The goal of the game is to beat all the levels. 
To beat a level, you must reach the door placed somewhere on the screen. 
Movement is by means of the conventional WASD, although S is not a feature in this game. 
Monsters are in the form of Anubi. Green Anubi are stationary and flip to face the general direction of you. 
Blue Anubi move back and forth over a decided path. Contact with either Anubi causes the loss of a life 
and the restart of the current level. Three deaths and it's Game Over.
